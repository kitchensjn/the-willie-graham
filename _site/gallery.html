The castle was frequently used by the royal court during the reign of Gustav III, who favored it and spent several months there every year. The perhaps most famous addition to the castle during his reign was a theater, which was added in one of the castle towers. It was the stage for both the amateur theatre of the royal court as well as The French Theater of Gustav III in 1781–1792. Stucco rendered to appear as rubbed brick on tower. After the Coup of 1809, Gustav IV Adolf and his family were also imprisoned in the castle after his deposition from the throne. He had to sign his abdication document there.</p><p>castle,tower,brick,masonry,stucco,stucco to resemble brick,brick patterned stucco</p>" data-categories="gripsholm castle,castle,tower,brick,masonry,stucco,stucco to resemble brick,brick patterned stucco">

An architectural design competition was held, which first resulted in the selection of drafts by Ragnar Östberg, Carl Westman, Ivar Tengbom jointly with Ernst Torulf, and Carl Bergsten. After a further competition between Westman and Östberg, the latter was assigned the construction of the City Hall, while the former was asked to build Stockholm Court House. Östberg modified his original draft using elements of Westman's design, including the tower. During construction, Östberg constantly reworked his plans, resulting in the addition of the lantern on top of the tower, and the abandonment of the blue glazed tiles in the Blue Hall. Oskar Asker was employed as construction leader and Paul Toll, of builders Kreuger & Toll, designed the foundations. Georg Greve also assisted in preparing the plans.[3] Construction took twelve years, from 1911 to 1923. Nearly eight million red bricks were used. The dark red bricks, called munktegel (monks's brick) because of their traditional use in the construction of monasteries and churches, were provided by Lina brickworks of Södertälje. The building was inaugurated on 23 June 1923, exactly 400 years after Gustav Vasa's arrival in Stockholm. Verner von Heidenstam and Hjalmar Branting delivered the inaugurational speeches.</p><p>tower,city hall</p>" data-categories="city hall,tower,city hall">

The church serves as the final resting place of most Swedish monarchs. Riddarholmen Church is located on the island of Riddarholmen, close to the Royal Palace in Stockholm, Sweden. The congregation was dissolved in 1807 and today the church is used only for burial and commemorative purposes. Swedish monarchs from Gustavus Adolphus (d. 1632 AD) to Gustaf V (d. 1950) are entombed here (with only one exception: Queen Christina who is buried within St. Peter's Basilica in Rome), as well as the earlier monarchs Magnus III (d. 1290) and Charles VIII (d. 1470). It has been discontinued as a royal burial site in favor of the Royal Cemetery and today is run by departments of the Swedish Government and Royal Court. It is one of the oldest buildings in Stockholm, parts of it dating to the late-13th century, when it was built as a greyfriars monastery. After the Protestant Reformation, the monastery was closed and the building became a Lutheran church. A spire designed by Flemish architect Willem Boy (1520–1592) was added during the reign of John III, but it was destroyed by a lightning strike on July 28, 1835, after which it was replaced with the present cast-iron spire.  Coats of arms of knights of the Royal Order of the Seraphim are on the walls of the church. When a knight of the Order dies, his coat of arms is hung in the church and when the funeral takes place the church's bells are rung without pause from 12:00 to 13:00.</p><p>church,medieval,spire,cast iron,chapel</p>" data-categories=",church,medieval,spire,cast iron,chapel">

The church serves as the final resting place of most Swedish monarchs. Riddarholmen Church is located on the island of Riddarholmen, close to the Royal Palace in Stockholm, Sweden. The congregation was dissolved in 1807 and today the church is used only for burial and commemorative purposes. Swedish monarchs from Gustavus Adolphus (d. 1632 AD) to Gustaf V (d. 1950) are entombed here (with only one exception: Queen Christina who is buried within St. Peter's Basilica in Rome), as well as the earlier monarchs Magnus III (d. 1290) and Charles VIII (d. 1470). It has been discontinued as a royal burial site in favor of the Royal Cemetery and today is run by departments of the Swedish Government and Royal Court. It is one of the oldest buildings in Stockholm, parts of it dating to the late-13th century, when it was built as a greyfriars monastery. After the Protestant Reformation, the monastery was closed and the building became a Lutheran church. A spire designed by Flemish architect Willem Boy (1520–1592) was added during the reign of John III, but it was destroyed by a lightning strike on July 28, 1835, after which it was replaced with the present cast-iron spire.  Coats of arms of knights of the Royal Order of the Seraphim are on the walls of the church. When a knight of the Order dies, his coat of arms is hung in the church and when the funeral takes place the church's bells are rung without pause from 12:00 to 13:00.</p><p>church,medieval,spire,cast iron,chapel</p>" data-categories=",church,medieval,spire,cast iron,chapel">

The castle was frequently used by the royal court during the reign of Gustav III, who favored it and spent several months there every year. The perhaps most famous addition to the castle during his reign was a theater, which was added in one of the castle towers. It was the stage for both the amateur theatre of the royal court as well as The French Theater of Gustav III in 1781–1792. After the Coup of 1809, Gustav IV Adolf and his family were also imprisoned in the castle after his deposition from the throne. He had to sign his abdication document there. 1701 date on interior of chapel</p><p>castle,chapel,fitting,interior,altar,reredos,altar rail,rail,balustrade,baroque</p>" data-categories="gripsholm castle,castle,chapel,fitting,interior,altar,reredos,altar rail,rail,balustrade,baroque">

The castle was frequently used by the royal court during the reign of Gustav III, who favored it and spent several months there every year. The perhaps most famous addition to the castle during his reign was a theater, which was added in one of the castle towers. It was the stage for both the amateur theatre of the royal court as well as The French Theater of Gustav III in 1781–1792. After the Coup of 1809, Gustav IV Adolf and his family were also imprisoned in the castle after his deposition from the throne. He had to sign his abdication document there. 1701 date on interior of chapel</p><p>castle,chapel,fitting,interior,chandelier,candle,candle chandelier</p>" data-categories="gripsholm castle,castle,chapel,fitting,interior,chandelier,candle,candle chandelier">

The castle was frequently used by the royal court during the reign of Gustav III, who favored it and spent several months there every year. The perhaps most famous addition to the castle during his reign was a theater, which was added in one of the castle towers. It was the stage for both the amateur theatre of the royal court as well as The French Theater of Gustav III in 1781–1792. After the Coup of 1809, Gustav IV Adolf and his family were also imprisoned in the castle after his deposition from the throne. He had to sign his abdication document there. 1701 date on pulpit</p><p>castle,chapel,fitting,interior,pulpit,sounding board,sound board,tester,acoorn,drop,stair,royal crest,gilt,candelabra,baroque</p>" data-categories="gripsholm castle,castle,chapel,fitting,interior,pulpit,sounding board,sound board,tester,acoorn,drop,stair,royal crest,gilt,candelabra,baroque">

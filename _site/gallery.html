This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

This includes the central portion of the house built with English bond cellar walls and Flemish above. The house was significantly rebuilt and retrimmed around 1840 possibly by Paschal J. Fowlkes. It was purchased in 1938 by Richmond department store owner William B. Thalhimer who used it as a training farm for Jewish students from Nazi Germany of the German agricultural Gross Breesen Institute. Two buildings sat to the rear of the house. One recently collapsed, leaving standing its two brick end chimneys. The Thalhimers referred to that building as the overseers' house, although it likely served as a kitchen and service building, with quarters upstairs--possibly for the overseer. A second structure remains standing that likely served as a double slave quarter. It is of frame construction and consists two rooms with a center chimney. Each room has its own, front exterior door. A tight winder stair rose in the front corner of the right room to an unheated and unfinished attic accessed only from the one side. The interior of the quarter appears to have had no finish until the 20th century. The frame sits on stone piers. The chimney is constructed of stone and includes large cooking fireplaces in each room. They are each spanned by a large oak lintel beveled on its rear and a wooden trammel bar that ran the width of the fireplace, set into its flue. Built of hewn and pit sawn framing and with mature, machine-cut nails. Conceivably it was constructed around 1840 when the house was first improved. The structure has been assumed to have been constructed as the kitchen and laundry for the site, but that seems unlikely.</p><p>talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney</p>" data-categories="hyde park,talheimer,hyde park,quarter,slave quarter,slave,enslaved,work,double quarter,slave house,timber frame,center chimney">

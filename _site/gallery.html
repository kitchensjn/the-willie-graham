The N was filled in with hide glue and brick dust and the new L carved over it presumably during original construction. All-glazed header Flemish bond with compass-headed windows and three gauged-and-rubbed frontispieces. The church burned in the early 20th century and so only the brick shell survives.

Built by David Minetree, who incuded his name in a brick mounted near teh east doorway, along with one that presently reads WL but was first made as WN. The N was filled in with hide glue and brick dust and the new L carved over it presumably during original construction. All-glazed header Flemish bond with compass-headed windows and three gauged-and-rubbed frontispieces. The church burned in the early 20th century and so only the brick shell survives.

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe, dining room, cornice, carve, chair board, base board, chimney piece, door, doorway, window, console, rococo" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe,dining room,cornice,carve,chair board,base board,chimney piece,door,doorway,window,console,rococo">

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe, basement, dining room, beaufat, carve, carving, glaze, glazed door" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe,basement,dining room,beaufat,carve,carving,glaze,glazed door">

The castle was frequently used by the royal court during the reign of Gustav III, who favored it and spent several months there every year. The perhaps most famous addition to the castle during his reign was a theater, which was added in one of the castle towers. It was the stage for both the amateur theatre of the royal court as well as The French Theater of Gustav III in 1781–1792. Stucco rendered to appear as rubbed brick on tower.

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers.

All-glazed header Flemish bond with compass-headed windows and three gauged-and-rubbed frontispieces. The church burned in the early 20th century and so only the brick shell survives.

The castle was frequently used by the royal court during the reign of Gustav III, who favored it and spent several months there every year. The perhaps most famous addition to the castle during his reign was a theater, which was added in one of the castle towers. It was the stage for both the amateur theatre of the royal court as well as The French Theater of Gustav III in 1781–1792. Stucco rendered to appear as rubbed brick on tower. After the Coup of 1809, Gustav IV Adolf and his family were also imprisoned in the castle after his deposition from the throne. He had to sign his abdication document there.<br><br>Location: Gripsholm Castle<br><br>City: Mariefred<br><br>State: Södermanland<br><br>Country: Sweden<br><br>Categories: castle, tower, brick, masonry, stucco, stucco to resemble brick, brick patterned stucco" data-categories="gripsholm castle,castle,tower,brick,masonry,stucco,stucco to resemble brick,brick patterned stucco">

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe, basement, dining room" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe,basement,dining room">

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe, parlor, mantel, chimneypiece, mantel piece, marble, carve, carving, shelf, entablature, chair board, cornice, window, base, baseboard, wash board, plaster, decorative plaster" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe,parlor,mantel,chimneypiece,mantel piece,marble,carve,carving,shelf,entablature,chair board,cornice,window,base,baseboard,wash board,plaster,decorative plaster">

An architectural design competition was held, which first resulted in the selection of drafts by Ragnar Östberg, Carl Westman, Ivar Tengbom jointly with Ernst Torulf, and Carl Bergsten. After a further competition between Westman and Östberg, the latter was assigned the construction of the City Hall, while the former was asked to build Stockholm Court House. Östberg modified his original draft using elements of Westman's design, including the tower. During construction, Östberg constantly reworked his plans, resulting in the addition of the lantern on top of the tower, and the abandonment of the blue glazed tiles in the Blue Hall. Oskar Asker was employed as construction leader and Paul Toll, of builders Kreuger & Toll, designed the foundations. Georg Greve also assisted in preparing the plans.[3] Construction took twelve years, from 1911 to 1923. Nearly eight million red bricks were used. The dark red bricks, called munktegel (monks's brick) because of their traditional use in the construction of monasteries and churches, were provided by Lina brickworks of Södertälje. The building was inaugurated on 23 June 1923, exactly 400 years after Gustav Vasa's arrival in Stockholm. Verner von Heidenstam and Hjalmar Branting delivered the inaugurational speeches.<br><br>Location: City Hall<br><br>City: Stockholm<br><br>State: <br><br>Country: Sweden<br><br>Categories: tower, city hall" data-categories="city hall,tower,city hall">

Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings.

Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting.

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe, chamber, mantel, chimneypiece, mantelpiece, fret, fretwork" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe,chamber,mantel,chimneypiece,mantelpiece,fret,fretwork">

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House.

The church serves as the final resting place of most Swedish monarchs. Riddarholmen Church is located on the island of Riddarholmen, close to the Royal Palace in Stockholm, Sweden. The congregation was dissolved in 1807 and today the church is used only for burial and commemorative purposes. Swedish monarchs from Gustavus Adolphus (d. 1632 AD) to Gustaf V (d. 1950) are entombed here (with only one exception: Queen Christina who is buried within St. Peter's Basilica in Rome), as well as the earlier monarchs Magnus III (d. 1290) and Charles VIII (d. 1470). It has been discontinued as a royal burial site in favor of the Royal Cemetery and today is run by departments of the Swedish Government and Royal Court. It is one of the oldest buildings in Stockholm, parts of it dating to the late-13th century, when it was built as a greyfriars monastery. After the Protestant Reformation, the monastery was closed and the building became a Lutheran church. A spire designed by Flemish architect Willem Boy (1520–1592) was added during the reign of John III, but it was destroyed by a lightning strike on July 28, 1835, after which it was replaced with the present cast-iron spire.  Coats of arms of knights of the Royal Order of the Seraphim are on the walls of the church. When a knight of the Order dies, his coat of arms is hung in the church and when the funeral takes place the church's bells are rung without pause from 12:00 to 13:00.<br><br>Location: <br><br>City: Stockholm<br><br>State: <br><br>Country: Sweden<br><br>Categories: church, medieval, spire, cast iron, chapel" data-categories=",church,medieval,spire,cast iron,chapel">

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe, palladian, banqueting house, party house, brick, masonry" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe,palladian,banqueting house,party house,brick,masonry">

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.)

The N was filled in with hide glue and brick dust and the new L carved over it presumably during original construction. All-glazed header Flemish bond with compass-headed windows and three gauged-and-rubbed frontispieces. The church burned in the early 20th century and so only the brick shell survives.

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe, monument, grounds, landscape, garden" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe,monument,grounds,landscape,garden">

The N was filled in with hide glue and brick dust and the new L carved over it presumably during original construction. All-glazed header Flemish bond with compass-headed windows and three gauged-and-rubbed frontispieces. The church burned in the early 20th century and so only the brick shell survives.

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe, brick, masonry, tuckpoint, struck, mortar, flemish bond, closer, header, stretcher, rub, rubbed brick" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe,brick,masonry,tuckpoint,struck,mortar,flemish bond,closer,header,stretcher,rub,rubbed brick">

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe, brick, masonry, grapevine, struck, mortar, flemish bond, closer, header, stretcher" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe,brick,masonry,grapevine,struck,mortar,flemish bond,closer,header,stretcher">

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe, kitchen, library, collondae, wing, hyphen, brick, masonry" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe,kitchen,library,collondae,wing,hyphen,brick,masonry">

Built by David Minetree, who incuded his name in a brick mounted near teh east doorway, along with one that presently reads WL but was first made as WN. The N was filled in with hide glue and brick dust and the new L carved over it presumably during original construction. All-glazed header Flemish bond with compass-headed windows and three gauged-and-rubbed frontispieces. The church burned in the early 20th century and so only the brick shell survives. Ray Cannetti, Kevin Nito and Robert Hall are presently restoring the frontispieces. 19th and 2oth-cenury grafitti<br><br>Location: Mattaponi Baptist Church<br><br>City: King and Queen County<br><br>State: Virginia<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: church, brick, masonry, grafitti" data-categories="mattaponi baptist church,church,brick,masonry,grafitti">

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe, brick, masonry, tuckpoint, struck, mortar, flemish bond, closer, header, stretcher, rub, rubbed brick" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe,brick,masonry,tuckpoint,struck,mortar,flemish bond,closer,header,stretcher,rub,rubbed brick">

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.)

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe, steps, stone, molded, portico" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe,steps,stone,molded,portico">

All-glazed header Flemish bond with compass-headed windows and three gauged-and-rubbed frontispieces. The church burned in the early 20th century and so only the brick shell survives.

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: blind dovetail hinge, door from hall to parlor" data-categories="whitehall,blind dovetail hinge,door from hall to parlor">

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe, porch, portico, garden, landscape, column, corinthian" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe,porch,portico,garden,landscape,column,corinthian">

The church serves as the final resting place of most Swedish monarchs. Riddarholmen Church is located on the island of Riddarholmen, close to the Royal Palace in Stockholm, Sweden. The congregation was dissolved in 1807 and today the church is used only for burial and commemorative purposes. Swedish monarchs from Gustavus Adolphus (d. 1632 AD) to Gustaf V (d. 1950) are entombed here (with only one exception: Queen Christina who is buried within St. Peter's Basilica in Rome), as well as the earlier monarchs Magnus III (d. 1290) and Charles VIII (d. 1470). It has been discontinued as a royal burial site in favor of the Royal Cemetery and today is run by departments of the Swedish Government and Royal Court. It is one of the oldest buildings in Stockholm, parts of it dating to the late-13th century, when it was built as a greyfriars monastery. After the Protestant Reformation, the monastery was closed and the building became a Lutheran church. A spire designed by Flemish architect Willem Boy (1520–1592) was added during the reign of John III, but it was destroyed by a lightning strike on July 28, 1835, after which it was replaced with the present cast-iron spire.  Coats of arms of knights of the Royal Order of the Seraphim are on the walls of the church. When a knight of the Order dies, his coat of arms is hung in the church and when the funeral takes place the church's bells are rung without pause from 12:00 to 13:00.<br><br>Location: <br><br>City: Stockholm<br><br>State: <br><br>Country: Sweden<br><br>Categories: church, medieval, spire, cast iron, chapel" data-categories=",church,medieval,spire,cast iron,chapel">

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe, bastion, recreation, garden, landsccape" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe,bastion,recreation,garden,landsccape">

The N was filled in with hide glue and brick dust and the new L carved over it presumably during original construction. All-glazed header Flemish bond with compass-headed windows and three gauged-and-rubbed frontispieces. The church burned in the early 20th century and so only the brick shell survives.

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.)

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers.

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe, stair, newel, scrolled soffit, mahogany, handrail, baluster, square baluster, ramp, easement, drop" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe,stair,newel,scrolled soffit,mahogany,handrail,baluster,square baluster,ramp,easement,drop">

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: hinge, strap hinge, wrapped eye, jamestown hinge, reverse strap" data-categories="whitehall,hinge,strap hinge,wrapped eye,jamestown hinge,reverse strap">

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers.

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe, basement, dining room, mantel, chimneypiece, console, bracket, carve, carving, wall of troy, fret, fretwork" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe,basement,dining room,mantel,chimneypiece,console,bracket,carve,carving,wall of troy,fret,fretwork">

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.)

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe">

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe, chamber, mantel, chimneypiece, mantelpiece, fret, fretwork" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe,chamber,mantel,chimneypiece,mantelpiece,fret,fretwork">

A God House is a charity where the sick and elderly were cared for in the name of God. There are only a few archive notes about the God House Hertsberge in Bruges. Located outside the neighboring beguinage, the Godshuis was originally a convent for poor beguines. A charter states that the convent was founded in 1335 by Griele and Marzoete van Herdsberghe./ That's where the houses probably got their name from. The Hertsberge houses may have evolved into God's houses for impoverished elderly women in the course of the late 14th and at the beginning of the 15th century./ The God Houses consist of seven typical single-story little houses with dot-facade and on the top an arc-opening, each with a Tudor or Cork Bowl door and only one window. The houses have their own chapel./In 1796, when Belgium was under French occupation, the French government placed the god house, like almost all of the city's caritative institutions, under a new board, the Civilian Houses of Commons. An organization to help the poor and the sick.

The castle was frequently used by the royal court during the reign of Gustav III, who favored it and spent several months there every year. The perhaps most famous addition to the castle during his reign was a theater, which was added in one of the castle towers. It was the stage for both the amateur theatre of the royal court as well as The French Theater of Gustav III in 1781–1792. After the Coup of 1809, Gustav IV Adolf and his family were also imprisoned in the castle after his deposition from the throne. He had to sign his abdication document there.<br><br>Location: Gripsholm Castle<br><br>City: Mariefred<br><br>State: Södermanland<br><br>Country: Sweden<br><br>Categories: castle, tower, brick, masonry, well, wellhead, dome, cupola" data-categories="gripsholm castle,castle,tower,brick,masonry,well,wellhead,dome,cupola">

The castle was frequently used by the royal court during the reign of Gustav III, who favored it and spent several months there every year. The perhaps most famous addition to the castle during his reign was a theater, which was added in one of the castle towers. It was the stage for both the amateur theatre of the royal court as well as The French Theater of Gustav III in 1781–1792. After the Coup of 1809, Gustav IV Adolf and his family were also imprisoned in the castle after his deposition from the throne. He had to sign his abdication document there. 1701 date on pulpit<br><br>Location: Gripsholm Castle<br><br>City: Mariefred<br><br>State: Södermanland<br><br>Country: Sweden<br><br>Categories: castle, chapel, fitting, interior, pulpit, sounding board, sound board, tester, acoorn, drop, stair, royal crest, gilt, candelabra, baroque" data-categories="gripsholm castle,castle,chapel,fitting,interior,pulpit,sounding board,sound board,tester,acoorn,drop,stair,royal crest,gilt,candelabra,baroque">

A God House is a charity where the sick and elderly were cared for in the name of God. There are only a few archive notes about the God House Hertsberge in Bruges. Located outside the neighboring beguinage, the Godshuis was originally a convent for poor beguines. A charter states that the convent was founded in 1335 by Griele and Marzoete van Herdsberghe./ That's where the houses probably got their name from. The Hertsberge houses may have evolved into God's houses for impoverished elderly women in the course of the late 14th and at the beginning of the 15th century./ The God Houses consist of seven typical single-story little houses with dot-facade and on the top an arc-opening, each with a Tudor or Cork Bowl door and only one window. The houses have their own chapel./In 1796, when Belgium was under French occupation, the French government placed the god house, like almost all of the city's caritative institutions, under a new board, the Civilian Houses of Commons. An organization to help the poor and the sick. Since 1974, the God houses are protected as a national monument. <br><br>Location: God House s of Hertsberge (Godsh<br><br>City: Bruge<br><br>State: West Flanders<br><br>Country: Belgium<br><br>Categories: flanders, baroque, door, doorway, mannerist, baroque, brick, entry, poor house, almshouse, gods house, god house, masonry, frontispiece" data-categories="god house s of hertsberge (godsh,flanders,baroque,door,doorway,mannerist,baroque,brick,entry,poor house,almshouse,gods house,god house,masonry,frontispiece">

A God House is a charity where the sick and elderly were cared for in the name of God. There are only a few archive notes about the God House Hertsberge in Bruges. Located outside the neighboring beguinage, the Godshuis was originally a convent for poor beguines. A charter states that the convent was founded in 1335 by Griele and Marzoete van Herdsberghe./ That's where the houses probably got their name from. The Hertsberge houses may have evolved into God's houses for impoverished elderly women in the course of the late 14th and at the beginning of the 15th century./ The God Houses consist of seven typical single-story little houses with dot-facade and on the top an arc-opening, each with a Tudor or Cork Bowl door and only one window. The houses have their own chapel./In 1796, when Belgium was under French occupation, the French government placed the god house, like almost all of the city's caritative institutions, under a new board, the Civilian Houses of Commons. An organization to help the poor and the sick. Since 1974, the God houses are protected as a national monument.<br><br>Location: God Houses of Hertsberge (Godshu<br><br>City: Bruge<br><br>State: West Flanders<br><br>Country: Belgium<br><br>Categories: flanders, baroque, door, doorway, mannerist, baroque, brick, entry, poor house, almshouse, gods house, god house, masonry, gable, dormer, dutch gable, frontispiece" data-categories="god houses of hertsberge (godshu,flanders,baroque,door,doorway,mannerist,baroque,brick,entry,poor house,almshouse,gods house,god house,masonry,gable,dormer,dutch gable,frontispiece">

Horatio Sharpe built Whitehall as a party or banqueting house in the 1760s. Some original design drawings survive, possibly from the hands of Joseph Horatio Anderson who later undertook construction of the Maryland State House. These drawings show the house partially as built but also with features that were not realized until the 20th century. Anderson drafted an octagonal stable, which was reportedly erected.  Dendro (Worhington) for the original build dates to the winter of 1764/65. That work included the main block, with a central cubed room flanked by one story wings. All three rooms were intended as entertaining spaces. The central hall has a vaulted ceiling with elaborate rococo plasterwork and heavily carved woodwork around the walls, doors, and windows. Some of the applied carvings to the walls are original, but heavily repaired in the 1950s. Plasterwork in the cove ceiling was also restored and elaborated at this time. (I presume the central ceiling medallion was wholly made up in the 1950s and that the original treatment is long lost.) The center hall has exquisite, full-length yellow pine flooring and no evidence of carpeting. The flanking rooms probably served as dining room and a parlor-like space. Both are heated, have plaster cornices, and have heavily carved woodwork. These rooms received several generations of carpeting. Since the quality of their flooring was less than the hall, they might have been fitted with them from the outset. The house was intended for entertainments and little accommodation was made for overnight guests, giving the structure a banqueting house like feel, albeit it without cellar service spaces (where the kitchen was placed is unknown for this original construction.) A basement story was created underneath with a passage and two vaulted rooms (probably at least one used for wet storage). Flanking them are two private family chambers. One undoubtedly served as a dining room and has an original beaufat (although its lo<br><br>Location: Whitehall<br><br>City: Anne Arundel Co.<br><br>State: MD<br><br>Country: USA<br><br>Categories: rococco, georgian, classical, 5 part house, dwelling, house, plantation, sharpe horation sharpe, gov. sharpe, dining room, cornice, carve, chair board, base board, chimney piece, door, doorway, rococo" data-categories="whitehall,rococco,georgian,classical,5 part house,dwelling,house,plantation,sharpe horation sharpe,gov. sharpe,dining room,cornice,carve,chair board,base board,chimney piece,door,doorway,rococo">
